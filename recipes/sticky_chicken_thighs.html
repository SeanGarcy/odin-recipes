    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <h3>For the Chicken:</h3>
        <li>500g boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into bite-sized pieces</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons sesame oil</li>
        <li>1/2 cup cornstarch</li>
        <li>2 eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>Oil, for frying</li>
        <li>Sesame seeds, for garnish</li>
        <li>Thinly sliced green onions, for garnish</li>
        <h3>For the Sticky Asian Sauce:</h3>
        <li>1 tablespoon oil</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ginger, minced</li>
        <li>5 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons rice vinegar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup honey</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch, mixed with 2 tablespoons water</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sesame oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon chili flakes (optional, adjust to taste)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Season the chicken pieces with salt and pepper, then marinate with 2 teaspoons of soy sauce and 2 teaspoons of sesame oil. Let it sit for at least 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>In a bowl, mix the cornstarch and eggs together until well combined. Add the marinated chicken pieces and toss to coat evenly.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large frying pan or a wok over medium-high heat. Add the chicken pieces in batches, being careful not to overcrowd the pan. Fry until they are golden brown and crispy, about 3-4 minutes per side. Remove the chicken and set aside on a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil.</li>
        <li>To make the sauce, heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and ginger, and saut√© until fragrant, about 1-2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the soy sauce, water, rice vinegar, honey, and brown sugar to the saucepan. Stir well and bring the mixture to a simmer.</li>
        <li>Mix 1 tablespoon of cornstarch with 2 tablespoons of water in a small bowl until smooth. Pour this mixture into the saucepan, stirring constantly, until the sauce thickens, about 2-3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in the sesame oil and chili flakes (if using) into the sauce. Taste and adjust seasoning if necessary.</li>
        <li>Add the fried chicken pieces back into the pan with the sauce. Toss well to ensure each piece is evenly coated with the sauce.</li>
        <li>Transfer the chicken to a serving dish. Garnish with sesame seeds and thinly sliced green onions.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately with rice or your favorite side dish. Enjoy your Crispy Sesame Chicken with Sticky Asian Sauce!</li>
    </ol>
